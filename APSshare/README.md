## ShadowOui installed recently on APSshare

**ShadowOui**, the new user interface for the well-known ray-tracing simulation software 
Shadow, and **XOPPY**, the python version of XOP, have been installed for linux 64-bit 
computers on the APS common file share: /APSshare.  This file share is mounted from 
the local DSERV server.  (Only support for linux 64-bit computers is available at this 
time.)   The software can be started with this command that starts the GUI:

For those wishing to install this software on their own linux workstation, the
